# RSVP-Project

This project is an app where:
1. Guests to a party can RSVP using the RSVP button (and they must provide 1 ether to check in).
2. Once all guests have RSVP'd, the host can check them in to the party.
3. If a guest does not arrive (and is hence not checked in), their staked ether will be distibuted amongst those guests who did check in. The guests who arrived to 
the party recieve their ether back.
